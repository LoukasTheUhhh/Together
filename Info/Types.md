# Types
******
Together has basically all the main types,and they are each surrounded by a unique symbol.\
It also has some unique types,like Shapes.
 | Type | Code Name | Symbol |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | Integers | ``int`` | * |
 | Floating Points | ``float`` | \| |
 | Booleans | ``bool`` | _ |
 | Lists | ``list`` | / |
 | Variables | ``vrb`` | first is [,second is ] |
 | Strings | ``str`` | " or ' |
 | Shapes | ``shape`` | -- |

 ## Integers
 Integers are your average non-decimal number,the weak of the numbers.
 Examples:
 ```together
 *2*
 *8*
 *420*
 *829285*
 ```
******
 ## Floating Points
 Floating Points(Or floats,for short) are your cool decimal number,the strong and cool,the one everyone wants as a friend.
 Examples:
 ```together
 |46.1|
 |9999999.9|
 |14601.97491|
 |69.420|
 ```
******
 ## Booleans
 Booleans are basically truth statements.
 Normally,there are only 2,`true` and `false`,But Together implements a new one,called `maybe`.
 It is basically a sub-trait of things that have values,but negative,like 0,or -7,or `null`.It can also be used as extra variety for your code.
 Examples:
 ```together
 _true_
 _false_
 _maybe_
 ```

## Lists,Variables and Shapes
  Lists,Variables and Shapes are all kinda complex,so they are explained in the ``Storing`` Folder. Check them out!
  ******
## Strings
  Strings are iconic,basically any line of quoted text.
  Examples:
  ```together
  "I am david"
  'And i want some ice cream'
  "Haha!I am a double quoted string!I have more quotes than you!you single quoted string!"
  ':('
 ```
