# Implementing
Implementing is a big feature of Together that implements other features that aren't there by default.\
It is possible to implement time,conditions,fast mode,etc.
******
## How to Implement
To implement features,you must run this line of code at the top of your code:
```together
!implement {feature} {optionalvalue} $$replace the words in {} with the feature's stuff.
```

Soon enough,they will become usable and widespread.
