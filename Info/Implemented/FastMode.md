# Fast Mode
Fast Mode is an implemented feature,that allows for scripts to turn from 20 lines to 1,100 to 6,and just make everything a whole lot easier.
******
## How to Implement it
Simply run this line of code at the start of your code:
```together
!implement FastMode
```
******
## What it does
Fast Mode makes so instead of having your "Hello World!" program look like 20 lines of code,makes it look like this:
```together
!implement FastMode
log("Hello World!")
```
It makes it just like Javascript or Python.
