# Fast Mode
Fast Mode is an implemented feature,that allows for scripts to turn from 20 lines to 1,100 to 6,and just make everything a whole lot easier.
******
## How to Implement it
Simply run this line of code at the start of your code:
```together
!implement FastMode
```
******
## What it does
Fast Mode makes so instead of having your "Hello World!" program look like 20 lines of code,makes it look like this:
```together
!implement FastMode
log("Hello World!")
```
It makes it just like Javascript or Python.
******
## Why Use It
Some,may find it annoying for scripts for simple stuff like "Hello World!" to be 20 lines of code,so instead,they are now only 2 lines of code.\
This feature is made for quick testing and for beginners.
******
## Global Storing
Because storing units are now no longer in storage grouplets,they have a different way of making themselves global.\
To make a global store unit,use the following line of code:
```together
glb {keyword} {name} = {value} $$the thinks in {} aren't supposed to be copied,just replaced with the things for that storing unit
```
