# Introduction
This is the Together Cheat Sheet,a giant file explaining everything shortly and briefly.

# The Function Cheat Sheet
 | Function | Syntax/Example | Use |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | ``Process(gl)`` | ``Process(actiongl) {...}`` | To Define the code of an grouplet.|
 | ``Connect(gl1, gl2)`` | ``Connect(actiongl, runnergl)`` | To connect two grouplets. |
 | ``log(any)`` | ``log("Hello World!")`` | To log anything to the console. |
 | ``display()`` | ``display("Alert!Alert!")`` | To display a message like an alert. |
 | ``prompt()`` | ``prompt("What's your name?")`` | To receive user input. |
 | ``type()`` | ``log(type("Heyo!"))`` | Doesn't do anything itself,just is the type of whatever is in the brackets. |
 | ``end()`` | ``end()`` | Ends the program. Any code beyond it is ignored. |
***
# The Logical Operator Cheat Sheet
 | Operator | Syntax/Example | Meaning |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | ``+++`` | ``If <_maybe_> =? <_false_> +++ <*2*> =?? <*3*>`` | The logical AND Operator. |
 | `\\` | ``If <_true_> \\= <_false_>`` | The logical NOT Operator. |
 | `<-->` | ``Else If <_false_> =? <_true_> <--> <*2*> =? <*2*>`` | The logical OR Operator. |

# The Arithmetical Operator Cheat Sheet
 | Operator | Use |
 | --- | --- |
 | + | Just the addition operator.Used for adding or combining. |
 | - | Just the subtraction operator.Used for decreasing. |
 | * | Just the multiplication operator.Used for math normally. |
 | / | Just the division operator.Used for math normally. |
 | % | Just the remainder operator.Used for math normally. |
 | +-+| Just the increment operator.Used for storing,loops and math. |
 | -+- | Just the decrement operator.Used for storing,loops and math. |
***
# The Assignment Operator Cheat Sheet
 | Operator | Use |
 | --- | --- |
 | = | The OG equal sign.Does not need an explanation. |
 | == | The TRUE value assigner. Assigning a value to anything with makes the value unchangeable no matter what.Does NOT work with other assignment operators. |
 | += | Make a new value for something,then do addition with the old one.
 | -= | Make a new value for something,then do substraction with the old one.
 | *= | Make a new value for something,then do multiplication with the old one.
 | /= | Make a new value for something,then do division with the old one,keeping the result.
 | %= | Make a new value for something,then do divison with the old one,keeping the remainder.
