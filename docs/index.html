      <p>
        Together is a new language of 5 forms that plans to combine all your needs into one. <br>
        It adds features like objects as dictionaries,the basics like variables,lists and functions,special,useful stuff like callbacks,or grouplets as snippets of code that need to be connected to make scripts,etc. <br>
        It has 5 versions:
        <ul>
          <li class="pop">Together Fast, the most high-level version of Together. For the guys and gals that use stuff such as Python or Javascript.</li>
          <li class="pop">Together Branch, introduces class-like syntax for Grouplets. Made for the class & function programmers such as Java and C programmers.</li>
          <li class="pop">Together Fruit, a sweet new syntax that introduces Connecting,a new way to make grouplets interact with eachother,packed with Runner and Action grouplets too. Made for the complex project programmers that want high customizabillity and more.</li>
          <li class="pop">Together Tree, like a DLC of Together Fruit with much more interactable connections,extra features such as shapes and callbacks,etc. For the same programmers as in Together Fruit.</li>
          <li class="pop">Together Merged, supports all of the above versions by just changing the <code class="code">!mode</code> tag at the start of a script,while also having its own features and upgrades such as subtypes and packages,with the <code class="code">Process{}</code> & <code class="code">Info{}</code> parts too of a grouplet. For the programmers that want full control over everything in their code: when it happens,how it happpens, why it happens, what happens,etc.</li>
        </ul>
