# Operators
Operators are the weird freaky symbols you use to combine strings, make mathematical theorys, etc.\
There are 5 main types of operators in Together Fast:
* Arithmetical Operators(+, -, %, +-+, etc.);
* Assigment Operators(=, ==, +=, %=, etc.);
* Conditional Operators(>, <, =?, etc.);
* Logical Operators(&, <->, @);
* Type Combining Operators(.., ++, etc.)

## Arithmetical Operators
### Definition
Arithmetical Operators are the operators for doing math equations and stuff such as multiplication, division remainder, etc.
### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `+` | The Addition Operator.
 `-` | The Subtract Operator.
 `*` | The Multiplication Operator.
 `/` | The Division Operator.
 `%` | The Modulus Operator.
 `+-` | The Increment Operator.
 `-+` | The Decrement Operator.
 `^` | The Power Operator.
***
## Assigment Operators
### Definition
Assignment Operators are used to set or update the values of variables.
### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `=` | The base assignment operator, used to give a value to a variable.
 `+=` | Adds a value to the variable and assigns it. `a += 2` = `a = a + 2`.
 `-=` | Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns it.
 `*=` | Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns it.
 `/=` | Divides the variable by a value and assigns it.
 `%=` | Applies modulus to the variable with a value and assigns it.
 `^=` | Raises the variable to a power and assigns it.
***
## Logical Operators
### Definition
The operators for changing conditions, multiple-valued-variables, etc.
### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `&` | The Logical AND Operator.
 `<->` | The Logical OR Operator.
 `@` | The Logical NOT operator.
***
## Conditional Operators
### Definition
The operators used to compare inside conditions.
### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `=?` | Equal To (value)
 `=??` | Equal To (value & type)
 `>` | Greater Than
 `<` | Smaller Than
 `=<=` | Greater Than <-> Equal To
 `=>=` | Smaller Than <-> Equal To
 `-==` | Starts With
 `=-=` | Includes
 `==-` | Ends With
***
## Type Combining Operators
### Definition
These are special operators for combining other types with each other, or something like combining strings.
### List
 Operator | Use
 --- | ---
 `..` | Combining Two Strings.
 (any arithmetical operator two times) | Doing that type of math between an integer and a float.
 `-.` | Removing parts of a string.
 `*.` | Multiplying a string.
 `/.` | Dividing a string (breaking it into multiple parts, and adding [n] after it, n being the part you want).
 `^.` | Multiplying a string by its length.
