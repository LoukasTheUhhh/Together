# Operators
Operators are the weird freaky symbols you use to combine strings,make mathematical theorys,etc.\
There are 5 main types of operators in Together Fast:
* Arithmetical Operators(+, -, %, +-+, etc.);
* Assigment Operators(=, ==, +=, %=, etc.);
* Conditional Operators(>, <, =?, etc.);
* Logical Operators(&, <->, @);
* Type Combining Operators(.., ++, etc.)

## Arithmetical Operators
### Definition
Arithmetical Operators are the operators for doing math equations and stuff such as multiplication,division remainder,etc.
### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `\+` | The Addition Operator.
 `\-` | The Subtract Operator.
 `\*` | The Multiplication Operator.
 `/` | The Division Operator.
 `%` | The Modulus Operator.
 `+-` | The Increment Operator.
 `-+` | The Decrement Operator.
 `^` | The Power Operator.
 ***
 ## Logical Operators
 ### Definition
 The operators for changing conditions,multiple-valued-variables,etc.
 ### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `&` | The Logical AND Operator.
 `<->` | The Logical OR Operator.
 `@` | The Logical NOT operator.
 ***
 ## Conditional Operators
 ### Definition
 The operators used to compare inside conditions.
 ### List
 Operator | Meaning
 --- | ---
 `=?` | Equal To (value)
 `=??` | Equal To (value & type)
 `>` | Greater Than
 `<` | Smaller Than
 `=<=` | Greater Than <-> Equal To
 `=>=` | Smaller Than <-> Equal To
 `-==` | Starts With
 `=-=` | Includes
 `==-` | Ends With
 ***
 ## Type Combining Operators
 ### Definition
 These are special operators for combining other types with eachother,or something like combining strings.
 ### List
 Operator | Use
 --- | ---
 `..` | Combining Two Strings.
 (any arithmetical operator two times) | Doing that type of math between an integer and a float.
 `-.` | Removing parts of a string.
 `*.` | Multiplying a string.
 `/.` | Dividing a string(breaking it into multiple parts,and adding [n] after it,n being the part you want.
 `^.` | Multiplying a string by its length.
